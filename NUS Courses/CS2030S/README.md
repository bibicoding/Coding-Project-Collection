## CS2030S Programming Methodology II

This course is a follow-up to CS1010S. It explores two modern programming paradigms: object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first-class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.

## About this folder

This folder contains relevant code files and documents that the author worked on in CS2030S. Most, if not all, of the code is written in Java. These documents include lab practices and practical examinations, which are hands-on implementations of object-oriented programming and functional programming in Java.
