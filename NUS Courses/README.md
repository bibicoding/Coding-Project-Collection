# NUS Courses

This folder contains coding projects and exercises from my Computer Science courses at NUS. It is organized by module, each covering different foundational topics in computer science.

## Modules

### ðŸ“Œ CS2030S - Programming Methodology II
- Focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Functional Programming** concepts.
- Implemented primarily in **Java**.
- Includes hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce:
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Higher-order functions and lambda expressions.
  - Immutability and stream processing.

### ðŸ“Œ CS2100 - Computer Organization
- Covers fundamental concepts of **computer systems and architecture**.
- Key topics include:
  - **Data representation** (binary, hexadecimal, twoâ€™s complement).
  - **C programming** (for memory management and system-level programming).
  - **Assembly language** (low-level manipulation and instruction set understanding).
  - **Digital logic and circuit design**.
  - **Pipelining and CPU performance optimizations**.
