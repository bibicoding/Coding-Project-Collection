I would use:

SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;

to output the averge number of each feature.

If the three numbers are higher than 0.5 (or maybe a higher number),
I would determine that the user's mood is positive, and vice versa.

Such calculation may be misleading when only a minority of songs have lower indexes but really low numbers (eg. 0.2),
while the majority of songs listened by the user are considered positive but not high numbers (eg. 0.52).
That would cause the overall average of indexes to be lower and assume that the user's mood is negative, but in fact
the user was just trying new style of music occasionally (perhaps).

I think a better way to calculate this is to find the number of songs those energy, danceability, or valence are
higher than a certain standard. Then find the proportion of those "happier" songs to the total songs listened by
the user this year.
