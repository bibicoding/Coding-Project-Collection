# Coding Project Collection

Welcome to Peter Chiang's Coding Project Collection repository! 
This repository is a comprehensive archive of my coding projects, exercises, and coursework from academic and self-driven learning experiences.

## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

- **NUS Courses:**  
  Contains coding projects and exercises from my Computer Science courses during my one-year stay at NUS. This folder includes assignments, practical exercises, and projects documenting my academic journey.

- **Self Study:**  
  Houses projects and exercises from various online courses and self-study initiatives. Here, youâ€™ll find work from courses like CS50P, CS50X, and NTU Java Training, as well as exercises and projects based on books and other learning resources from the summer of 2024.
