# Coding-Project-Collection

This is Chiang Peng-Yi's Coding Project Collection, which contains various projects that I completed in the summer of 2024. The collection features projects in different coding languages, including **Python, Java, C, JavaScript**, and more. I've arranged the projects into distinct files, each representing assignments or practices from online courses I had enrolled in. I will continue updating this repository throughout my coding journey, so stay tuned for more updates.

### CS50P
This is CS50P, an online course established by the CS50 team at Harvard that provides an introduction to Python.
CS50P introduces **Syntaxes and Datatypes**, then moves to **Variables and Loops**.

The course culminates when Professor Maylan (The director and lecturer of CS50) introduces further applications of Python.

In the CS50P Project Folder are the weekly projects I've done while learning
